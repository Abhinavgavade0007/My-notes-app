# Notes App (React)

This is a simple Notes App built using React.
It is my first React project, made to understand how React works, especially state, events, and basic component structure.

The app allows users to add notes with a title and details, view them on the screen, and delete them when not needed.

# What this project does

Add notes with a title and description
Show all recently added notes
Delete any note
Simple and clean UI
Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS

# Why I made this project

I made this project to practice:
React functional components
useState hook
Handling form inputs
Updating arrays in state
Basic UI design with Tailwind CSS

# How the app works (in simple words)

The app uses React useState to store:
note title
note details
list of all notes
When the form is submitted:
the note is added to an array
input fields are cleared
Notes are displayed on the screen as cards
Each note has a Delete button to remove it

# Tech used
React.js
JavaScript
Tailwind CSS

# Future improvements

Edit notes
Save notes using localStorage
Better input validation
Improve UI
